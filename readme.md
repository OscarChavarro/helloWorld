# Leet-code trainning examples

This repository contains basic Leet-code type exercises for data structures and algorithms currently used in real interviews.
Several can be used as the first exposure to a specific object, thus the `helloWorld` name.

## How to go fast

After taking some real life interviews, there are some tips on how to spend the less amount of time possible:

* Are debug tools available? IntelliJ allows check results, if only console output is available, will have to spend code in printing routines
* Do not use private attributes, do everything at a single package and make attributes package private
* Memorize main algorithms! Have no time to develop them.
* For data structures as such graphs, avoid storing distances to others in the class, use the strategy pattern class for that
* For graphs, understand how to make use of Maps

## Running TypeScript based solutions

```bash
npm run build 
npm start
```
